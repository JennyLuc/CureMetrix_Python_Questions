# CureMetrix_Python_Questions

This repository contains the code to the impelementations of:
- A function that takes two integers (x and y) and returns a list of numbers between x and y that are divisible by 5 but not by 7.
- A function that takes two integers (x and b) as inputs and returns a string that represents the number x in base b.
- A generator that takes a number N and returns all perfect squares less than N.
- A function that takes a series of movements and at the
end of the sequence of movements to print
1. The distance traveled by the rook
2. How far away the Rook is from its starting point

## Files
1. divide.py
2. converting_numbers.py
3. perfect_square.py
4. rook_game1.py
5. test_python_questions.py

### Divide.py
This file contains the method
    divisibe_five_not_seven()
Where it takes in the parameters 'lower' and 'upper' and returns a list of numbers between x and y that are divisible by 5 but not by 7.

How to run the divide.py file  
    python divide.py -l 4 -u 90
This will return a list of numbers from 4 to 90 where the numbers are divisible by 5 but not by 7.
